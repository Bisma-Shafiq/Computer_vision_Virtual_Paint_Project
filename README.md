# Computer_vision_Virtual_Paint_Project
**Description**:
Create an immersive virtual painting experience where users can paint digitally by utilizing contour detection to track objects' movements in real-time, facilitated through computer vision techniques.

**Details**:

1- Implementation: Developed using Python and OpenCV library, exploiting its robust image processing and computer vision functionalities.

2- Contour Detection: Employ contour detection algorithms to track objects' movements, enabling users to paint on a virtual canvas by manipulating objects within the camera's view.

3- Real-time Interaction: Provides seamless real-time interaction between detected contours and the virtual painting canvas, ensuring an immersive painting experience.

4- Color Selection: Enables users to select different colors for painting, enhancing creative possibilities and customization.

5- User Interface: Features a user-friendly interface for easy interaction, incorporating options for color palette selection and brush size adjustment.

6- Compatibility: Developed and tested on PyCharm software, ensuring compatibility and facilitating ease of development.

7- Application: Ideal for educational purposes, creative exploration, or interactive installations, providing an engaging experience for users to express their creativity digitally through contour-based painting.
